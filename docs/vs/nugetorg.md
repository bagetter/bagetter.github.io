[nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/), also known as the "Gallery", is the defacto feed to host open
source packages. You should publish NuGet packages for your open-source projects here.

The Gallery is battle-tested and proven to scale well. You can find a guide on how to host
your own Gallery instance on [the Gallery's wiki](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/wiki/Hosting-nuget.org's-v3-services).
You can find the Gallery's code on GitHub:

* [NuGet/NuGetGallery](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery) - the [nuget.org](https://nuget.org)
website and v2 APIs
* [NuGet/NuGet.Jobs](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Jobs/) - the Gallery's jobs for things like validation and package statistics.
* [NuGet/NuGet.Services.Metadata](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Services.Metadata/) - NuGet's v3 implementation
* [NuGet/ServerCommon](https://github.com/NuGet/ServerCommon) - common libraries used across NuGet's services

As you can tell, nuget.org is a complex beast. Hosting your own instance of the Gallery is not for the faint of heart.

# BaGetter vs nuget.org

TODO. See [this issue](https://github.com/loic-sharma/BaGet/issues/71) for a deep-dive.

* BaGetter only competes with [NuGet/NuGet.Services.Metadata](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Services.Metadata/)
* nuget.org's v3 implementation is static
    * Runs only on Windows
    * Highly tied to Azure
    * Scales reads to near infinity
    * Doesn't scale well for writes
    * Static JSON files are hosted on Azure Blob Storage
    * Served by a Content Delivery Network
    * Files are updated by `feed2catalog`, `catalog2registration`, `catalog2dnx`, and `catalog2lucene` jobs
* BaGetter's v3 implementation is dynamic
    * Cross-platform implementation
    * Requests are served by a service that queries a database
    * Simpler architecture, which makes it easier to deploy and run small feeds
    * Easier to scale for writes
    * Harder to scale for reads
    * Easier to add new features
    * Harder to make as reliable
